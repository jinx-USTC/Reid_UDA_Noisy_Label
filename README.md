# Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Re-Identification for reid, with clustering and noisy label techniques.

Implementation of the paper [Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Re-Identification: Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11334), and [Probabilistic End-to-end Noise Correction for Learning with Noisy Labels][http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Yi_Probabilistic_End-To-End_Noise_Correction_for_Learning_With_Noisy_Labels_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf
]
The selftraining scheme proposed in the paper is simple yet effective.
